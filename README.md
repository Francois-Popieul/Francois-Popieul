# 👋 Hi, I am François Popieul!

### 🎮 Video Game Translator & Aspiring Developer

With 24 years of experience in video game translation, I have a deep passion for language and technology. My developper career began by creating automation scripts with AutoHotkey to streamline translation workflows. This curiosity led me to learn C# by myself, whick allowed me to develop custom tools to support my work and fellow translators.

### 💻 Expanding into Web Development

Currently, I am sharpening my application design and development skills with a comprehensive course at Simplon Grenoble, focusing on:
- JavaScript, TypeScript & React
- Node.js & SQL
- UI/UX Design with Figma

I enjoy building tools that improve productivity and create delightful user experiences.
